# Introduction

The research project ‘eCommerce Widget for Sustainability’ aims to assess the potential of digital interventions to improve individual food selection in eCommerce environments. In particular, the goal of this research project is to identify the impact of sustainability-oriented labels on consumer behavior. Therefore, we will implement a web-based browser extension that seamlessly integrates into existing online grocery shopping websites to visualize the environmental impact of a product to the consumer. Further, the application is designed to track how consumers engage with the website (e.g. which products are looked at and which products are actually purchased) post-exposure to the sustainability label.

This project is based on product data from the eCommerce website as well as data from a database, which includes more than 6k products with data on the environmental emissions.

This project is a research project of the Auto-ID Labs ETH/HSG (www.autoidlabs.ch). Find out more about the research project here: https://www.autoidlabs.ch/projects/ecommerce-widget-for-nutrition-and-sustainability/
